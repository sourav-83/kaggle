# Kaggle Competitions Collection

This repository contains a collection of my solutions to various Kaggle competitions. The notebooks reflect my continuous learning in machine learning and data science as a CSE student at BUET.

These projects cover beginner to intermediate-level problems and demonstrate a wide range of techniques in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and submission formatting.
